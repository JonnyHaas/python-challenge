## Python-Challenge -  The challenge was to generate script for two different projects.  The two projects are named PyBank and PyPoll.

### Pybank:
* This Script reads a CSV resourse file for PYBank project.
* The financial dataset is called buget_data.csv
* The dataset is composed of two columns:  "Date" and "profit/losses"

* Task: Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
*	The total number of months included in the dataset
*	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
*	The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
*	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
*	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

### Utilize Built-in Modules for Python to navigate across our file system:
*	Import os - lets Python know our operating system is Windows

*	Import csv - module for importing csv files

### back up one directory and then forward one directory to read csv file

* This Script reads a CSV resourse file for PYPoll project.
* The Poll dataset is called election_data.csv
* The dataset is composed of three columns:  "Ballot ID", "County", and "Candidate"

* Task: Python script that analyzes the votes and calculate each of the following values:
*	The total number of votes cast
*	A complete list of candidates who recieved votes
*	The percentage of votes each candidate won
*	The total number of votes each candidate won
*	The winner of the election based on popular vote

### Utilize Built-in Modules for Python to navigate across our file system:
*	Import os - lets Python know our operating system is Windows

*	Import csv - module for importing csv files

### back up one directory and then forward one directory to read csv file

* The final script should both print the analysis to the terminal (script file) and export a text file in the same directory.
*	Script file is located in analysis folder
*	Dataset file is located in Resources folder

### PyPoll is as follows:
* This Script reads a CSV resourse file for PYPoll project.
* The Poll dataset is called election_data.csv
* The dataset is composed of three columns:  "Ballot ID", "County", and "Candidate"

### Task: Python script that analyzes the votes and calculate each of the following values:
*	The total number of votes cast
*	A complete list of candidates who recieved votes
*	The percentage of votes each candidate won
*	The total number of votes each candidate won
*	The winner of the election based on popular vote

### Utilize Built-in Modules for Python to navigate across our file system:
*	Import os - lets Python know our operating system is Windows

*	Import csv - module for importing csv files

### back up one directory and then forward one directory to read csv file

### The final script should both print the analysis to the terminal (script file) and export a text file in the same directory.
*	Script file is located in analysis folder
*	Dataset file is located in Resources folder

*	I utilized Chatgpt to help me write the scripts for both projects.  I broke down the asks into individual tasks and confirmed each task worked before moving on.  After getting all tasks to calculate and out put correctly, I combined the them to complete all  tasks in one script.
*	while writing the scripts, because both scripts were named "main.py", while working within subline text, at one time I saved the wrong "main.PV over the top of the other main.py.  In order to avoid possible error, it would seem important to not use the same file name for script.  Therefore, I named one of my script files main1.py.
