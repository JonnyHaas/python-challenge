Python-Challenge -  The challenge was to generate script for two different projects.  The two projects are named PyBank and PyPoll.

Pybank:
# This Script reads a CSV resourse file for PYBank project.
# The financial dataset is called buget_data.csv
# The dataset is composed of two columns:  "Date" and "profit/losses"

# Task: Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
#	The total number of months included in the dataset
#	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
#	The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
#	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
#	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

# Utilize Built-in Modules for Python to navigate across our file system:
#	Import os - lets Python know our operating system is Windows

#	Import csv - module for importing csv files

# back up one directory and then forward one directory to read csv file

# This Script reads a CSV resourse file for PYPoll project.
# The Poll dataset is called election_data.csv
# The dataset is composed of three columns:  "Ballot ID", "County", and "Candidate"

# Task: Python script that analyzes the votes and calculate each of the following values:
#	The total number of votes cast
#	A complete list of candidates who recieved votes
#	The percentage of votes each candidate won
#	The total number of votes each candidate won
#	The winner of the election based on popular vote

# Utilize Built-in Modules for Python to navigate across our file system:
#	Import os - lets Python know our operating system is Windows

#	Import csv - module for importing csv files

# back up one directory and then forward one directory to read csv file

#The final script should both print the analysis to the terminal (script file) and export a text file in the same directory.
#	Script file is located in analysis folder
#	Dataset file is located in Resources folder

PyPoll is as follows:
# This Script reads a CSV resourse file for PYPoll project.
# The Poll dataset is called election_data.csv
# The dataset is composed of three columns:  "Ballot ID", "County", and "Candidate"

# Task: Python script that analyzes the votes and calculate each of the following values:
#	The total number of votes cast
#	A complete list of candidates who recieved votes
#	The percentage of votes each candidate won
#	The total number of votes each candidate won
#	The winner of the election based on popular vote

# Utilize Built-in Modules for Python to navigate across our file system:
#	Import os - lets Python know our operating system is Windows

#	Import csv - module for importing csv files

# back up one directory and then forward one directory to read csv file

#The final script should both print the analysis to the terminal (script file) and export a text file in the same directory.
#	Script file is located in analysis folder
#	Dataset file is located in Resources folder
